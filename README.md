# Control-Yamaha-RX-V1500-via-Airplay
This tiny script is made for media servers with running Airplay/Shairport-Server (e.g. Raspberry PI). If any client connects to the airplay server it will send an RS232 command to a Yamaha RX-V1500 reciever and turn it on. If the clients disconnects it will turn the receiver off again.
